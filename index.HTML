          <h3>A brief description of Santos Dumont's early life and greatest triumphs.</h3>
          <section id="tribute-1">
          <p>Alberto Santos-Dumont was the sixth child of Henrique Dumont, an engineer who graduated from the Central School of Arts and Manufactures in Paris, and Francisca de Paula Santos. Until the age of 10, Santos-Dumont was schooled by his older sister, Virginia. From 10 to 12 years old he studied at Colégio Culto à Ciência, without having stood out among the classes. He then studied at Colégio Kopke in São Paulo, Colégio Morton, and Colégio Menezes Vieira in Rio de Janeiro, and later at the School of Engineering from Minas, without having finished the course.</p> <p>At the age of seven Santos-Dumont was already driving the farm's locomotives, and at twelve he was having fun as a locomotive engineer, capable of exhausting a man three times his age, but the speed achievable on land was not enough for him. By reading the works of the French writer Jules Verne, with whose fictional heroes he was compared in the course of his life, was born in Santos-Dumont the desire to conquer the air.</p>

          <section id="tribute-2">
          <p>The first airship designed by Santos-Dumont, the N-1, 25 metres long and 186 cubic metres, had its first takeoff attempt in February 1898, after being inflated in Henri Lachambre's workshops in Vaugirard. But snowy conditions caused the airship to bend and fall. "At a height of five or six metres, over Longchamp, the apparatus suddenly bent and the crash began. Of my entire career, this is the most abominable memory I have in store."</p>
            <p>In 1899, Santos-Dumont built a new aircraft, the N-2, with the same length and more or less the same shape, but with a larger diameter: 3.80 metres, which increased the volume to 200 cubic metres. Considering the inadequacy of the air pump, which had almost killed him, he added a small aluminum fan to ensure that the shape of the balloon remained unchanged.</p>
            <p>On 24 March, 1900, the Jewish millionaire oil magnate Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe sent the President of the Aeroclub of France, which had been founded two years earlier, a letter in which he promised to award 100,000 francs to anyone who could invent an efficient flying machine. The challenge became known in the press as the Deutsch Prize. The regulations stipulated that an aircraft, to be considered practical, must be able to fly to the Eiffel Tower, round the monument, and return to the place of ascent in no more than thirty minutes, without stops, covering a total of 11 kilometres under the eyes of a commission from the Aeroclub de France, convened at least one day in advance. The minimum average speed to be reached, therefore, was 22 km/h.</p>
            <p>On 19 October 1901, with the 622 cubic metre N-6 balloon with a 20 horsepower engine, Santos Dumont finally executed the challenge in 29 minutes and 30 seconds, but it took about a minute to land, which caused the committee to initially deny the award. This became a matter of controversy, as both the public and Mr. Deutsch believed that the aviator had won. After some time and the aviator protesting this decision, it was reversed. He became internationally recognized as the world's greatest aviator and the inventor of the airship.</p>

          <section id="tribute-3">
          <p>In October 1904, three aviation prizes were founded in France: the Archdeacon Prize, the French Aeroclub Prize, and the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize. The first, promoted by millionaire Ernest Archdeacon, would award 3,500 francs to anyone who flew 25 metres; the second, instituted by the French aeroclub, would award 1,500 francs ($300) to anyone who flew 100 metres; and the third, sponsored by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe and Ernest Archdeacon, would award 1,500 francs to anyone who flew 1,000 metres.</p>
          <p>He then built a hybrid machine, the 14-bis or Oiseau de Proie, consolidating his studies of what had been done in aviation until then, finished after two months, at the end of the first half of 1906, an airplane attached to a hydrogen balloon to reduce weight and facilitate takeoff. For completing the 14-bis, on 18 July Dumont signed up to compete in the events and presented the exotic aircraft for the first time the next day, attached to a balloon, at Bagatelle, where he ran some races, obtaining appreciable jumps</p>
          <p>On 23 October, Santos-Dumont presented himself at Bagatelle with the Oiseau de Proie II, a modification of the original model. The plane had been varnished to reduce the porosity of the fabric and increase lift. The rear wheel had been removed. In the morning he limited himself to maneuvering the airplane across the lawn, until the propeller shaft broke, not being repaired until the afternoon, after which the plane was moved into position for an official attempt. A crowd was present and had expectations with the day's presentation. At 4:45 pm, Santos-Dumont started the engine.</p>
        <p>
        The race had been completed. More than twice the predetermined distance had been covered. The crewed plane had lifted off into space and sustained itself for 60 metres in mid-air, without taking advantage of headwinds, or using ramps, catapults, slopes, or other devices. The flight had taken place solely by the aircraft's own means, and Europeans at the time believed it was the first such achievement. The crowd celebrated in excitement, ran up to the pilot and carried him off in triumph.</p>

            <p>"Now my playmates never failed to wink and smile mockingly at me when one of them called 'Man flies!' for at the word I would always lift my finger very high, as a sign of absolute conviction; and I refused with energy to pay the forfeit. The more they laughed at me, the happier I was, hoping that some day the laugh would be on my side."</p>
